                            <p>Barry Bodiford and his wife, Allison, launched the original 360clean business as a part-time
                                venture to test the waters of business ownership. “I specifically remember taking off my
                                business suit at the end of the work day and putting on my 360clean gear for another night
                                of working on and in my business,” says Barry.</p>

                            <p>The two founders of Archon Systems Inc. met while they were doing internships in California.
                                They worked to build a custom-made inventory system for a corporate client, which was just
                                the beginning. They realized companies needed awesome pre-made solutions so that they wouldn't
                                have to be built out each time. From there, InFlow Inventory was born!</p>
                            <p>How does Archon Systems Inc. manage their customers? They use Grasshopper. Matt Kostanecki, Head
                                of Business Development, loves having individual extensions for different team members. He
                                also loves being able to transfer calls from cell phones so that the team can work together
                                to solve any customer issues.</p>
                            <p>When we asked Matt about his favorite ice cream flavor, he was quick to answer: &ldquo;We prefer
                                red velvet frozen yogurt via Menchies (they're a customer of ours!)&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Despite the name, Auspicious Fish doesn’t have anything to do with fishing. Its founder, Linda,
                                started the company as an alternative offering of wellness and recovery services to individuals
                                facing challenging live situations. After experiencing a lifetime of traditional systems,
                                she came to believe the medical model for treating mental and physical health was not as
                                effective as it could be, so she created Auspicious Fish as a way to bridge the gap.</p>
                            <p>Linda found Grasshopper when searching for a toll free number on a budget. She loves that she
                                can customize her extensions and voicemail boxes to fit her particular needs.</p>
                            <p>Outside of caring for her patients, Linda’s love for the outdoors has her hiking and enjoying
                                the beach as much as she can!</p>

                            <p>Ever lose an important business document because you didn't have a great backup system? Background
                                Backup tries to solve that problem, automatically backing up your work so that you don't
                                have to think about it.</p>
                            <p>The system is for small and medium-sized businesses that want a solution without any hassle!</p>
                            <p>Bonus? Background Backup uses Grasshopper.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;We love Grasshopper and rely on it every day to keep Background Backup's calls flowing,&rdquo;
                                says Sean Costello, Director of Operations. &ldquo;One part of the service that I dearly
                                love is the ability to very quickly and easily get new vanity 800 number and out-of-region
                                numbers - Eezy Peezy!&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Sean also likes the ability to log in and see recent call history so that he can check out usage
                                trends. And, ironically, his favorite ice cream flavor mimics a grasshopper: mint chocolate
                                chip.</p>

                            <p>Balanced Numbers is the realization of a life-long dream for its owner, Pamela. After working
                                over 30 years for other companies, enduring long commutes and pressure to conform, she found
                                her calling after filling in on some tasks for a friend’s small business. She had always
                                known she wanted to own her own business, but had now found her niche. She created Balanced
                                Numbers as a way to help other small businesses run efficiently, and their owners to maintain
                                a healthy work/life balance.</p>
                            <p>Pamela likes how Grasshopper helps to give her business a professional, polished look, but is
                                easy to set up and use behind the scenes. She can easily get her calls wherever she is, and
                                always know who’s calling her business.</p>
                            <p>In addition to helping small business owners, she loves to indulge in hot fudge sundaes with
                                mint chocolate chip ice cream!</p>

                            <p>Pamela O’Hara, CEO and Co-Founder, chose Grasshopper when she was looking for a phone system.
                                Pamela’s favorite features? Voicemail transcription. “We use Grasshopper for product support
                                calls, so getting an e-mail into the support queue with a translation of the message helps
                                us quickly prioritize the urgency of the call,” says Pamela. </p>
                            <p>But Pamela isn’t just a hardworking business owner. She’s also gaga for ice cream. Her favorite
                                flavor? “Mint chocolate chip with chocolate fudge sauce. Always has been, always will be.
                                I even served it at my wedding.”</p>

                            <p>Bi-State Wildlife Hotline is a 24 hour hotline that helps Missouri and Illinois residents with
                                wildlife rescue, rehab and wildlife conflicts of all kinds.</p>
                            <p> In Missouri and Illinois many animal control departments do not assist the public with wildlife.
                                When a resident finds an orphaned or sick raccoon, skunk, fox, bird, etc. they are told to
                                ''let nature take its course''. The Bi-State Wildlife Hotline gives residents an alternative
                                solution and offers wildlife a second chance. By being available 24/7 they are able to assist
                                the public when all other services are unable to do so.</p>
                            <p>Founder Angel Wintrode loves that Grasshopper allows volunteers to receive calls no matter where
                                they are. “When a call comes in to our main queue, it rings everyone who is scheduled at
                                that moment – which might be ten different people across two states,” she says. “Grasshopper
                                has been a godsend for us!”</p>

                            <p>Brilliant Directories is an all-in-one member management solution and website builder that streamlines
                                all aspects of membership and association websites. Founded in 2009 by lifelong friends Matthew
                                Brooks and Jason Haloossim in their apartment, the company now has customers worldwide and
                                over 25 employees.</p>
                            <p>Grasshopper was a perfect solution for them because they were able to get a toll free number
                                without having to purchase any hardware. The ability to add their employees to an extension
                                while still allowing them to use their own cell phone has allowed them to grow their phone
                                system with their team, and allows them to simplify and streamline their jobs.</p>

                            <p>Brimtech’s founders were driving through a cloud of bugs when they ran out of washer fluid. They
                                realized how useful it would be to have a washing system that would keep itself full, and
                                thanks to that experience the first self-filling windshield washing system was born. </p>
                            <p>Not only does Brimtech’s solution make windshield washing easier, it’s also environmentally friendly.
                                Their innovative system adds to the growing list of modern conveniences that not only make
                                life easier but also helps ensure the consumer is doing their part to keep our planet green!</p>
                            <p>Brimtech is in love with their custom toll-free number. “We are so happy with Grasshopper,” says
                                President James Weigle. “They offer professional phone service and are a company we know
                                that we can grow with as our company expands.”</p>
                            <p>James loves travelling to Las Vegas, where Brimtech has been featured at the SEMA Show for aftermarket

                            <p>Captain401 is made up of young, social entrepreneurs who believe that the financial industry
                                could use more transparency and efficiency. They feel that people have been told by the financial
                                industry that investing and saving are very complex things that a layperson would not be
                                able to understand without an expensive financial advisor helping them out. So they started
                                Captain401 as a way to help small businesses and startups make financial decisions about
                                offering 401(k)s clear and easy.</p>
                            <p>With Grasshopper, they like being able to set up extensions for different departments so their
                                clients can be connected to the right people quickly. They also make use of the call log,
                                which makes it easy for them to keep track of call history and the necessary follow-ups.</p>
                            <p>The number one snack you’ll find with this crew is wasabi covered peas – they’ve convinced themselves
                                that it’s healthy!</p>

                            <p>CigarsFor.Me is an online cigar recommendation service that chooses the perfect cigars for you.
                                No prior cigar knowledge needed!</p>
                            <p>From the age of 18, founder Grayson Ervin has enjoyed smoking and learning about cigars. The
                                complicated thing about cigar smoking is that it takes hours of research just to scratch
                                the surface of the world’s infinite cigar selection. Lucky for Grayson, he loves researching
                                cigars and started picking ones out for his friends that he knew they’d love. That's when
                                he had the idea to remove the confusion and develop CigarsFor.Me ,the personalized cigar
                                recommendation service.</p>
                            <p>Grayson uses Grasshopper for all of his business calls. “When your business isn’t big enough
                                to dedicate a person to the phone lines it makes Grasshopper an absolute must have service,”
                                he says. He also loves that he can have unlimited extensions so Grasshopper can grow as his
                                business does.</p>
                            <p>When Grayson isn’t busy researching cigars, you might find him eating sushi, his favorite food.</p>

                            <p>Community Response Systems is the brainchild of its founder, John Kessler. He started the business
                                after assisting a security assessment at his son’s daycare, where the panic buttons performed
                                poorly during the test. He wanted to make sure there was a way for law enforcement to be
                                notified of emergency situations as quickly as possible. Using his 15 years of law enforcement
                                and security consulting experience, he built CRS Notify.</p>
                            <p>John says his favorite part of using Grasshopper is that it’s helped him grow his sales by making
                                it easier for customers to reach him. He can have a decentralized business setup, and still
                                be connected when customers need him.</p>

                            <p>Everything Happy specializes in creating fun blankets, pillows, and stuffed animals for young
                                children.</p>
                            <p>Their “One to Love, One to Give” mission means that for each Everything Happy product sold, one
                                is given to a child in need—in hospitals, orphanages, and impoverished communities throughout
                                the globe.</p>
                            <p>Creator, David Holdridge, developed the idea for Everything Happy’s flagship product, the Happy
                                Blankie, when he was only seven years old. His young sister treasured both her stuffed animals
                                and her blankies, so David thought to combine them. Two years later, Happy Blankie and the
                                One to Love, One to Give philosophy were born.</p>

                                stage of their lives. She believes it’s her life’s mission to be a midwife and care for women
                                of all ages, and opening her practice is her way of fulfilling that mission.</p>
                            <p>Laura tells us Grasshopper has been great for streamlining communication with her patients, which
                                is extremely important in her line of work. One of her favorite features is being able to
                                use the app to call a patient back through the push notification, rather than having to dial
                                the number.</p>

                            <p>Hobbit Holes by Wooden Wonders builds creative and unique spaces that can be used as chicken
                                coops, playhouses, home offices, sheds, and more!</p>
                            <p>Based in Maine, the company started as a way to allow owner and carpenter Rocy Pillsbury to work
                                from home and spend more time with his new son, Richard.</p>
                            <p>Hobbit Holes was started in 2009 when they brought two prototypes to the Common Ground County
                                Fair. Rocy and Melissa Pillsbury remember, “We were absolutely swarmed with playing children
                                all three days of the event, so we knew we had something that appealed to kids.” And the
                                rest is history!</p>

                            <p>Hyperstreet is a small company that sells web hosting products and reviews and compares other
                                web hosting companies alongside their products. Their founder, Nathan, tells us they grew
                                from a “roll of pennies” to a staff of almost 6, and the team loves what they do and love
                                seeing happy customers.</p>
                            <p>They use Grasshopper to rotate calls to whoever is on staff at any given time, and like how they’re
                                able to keep track of missed calls and return them in the order they’re received, which allows
                                them to better service their customers.</p>

                            <p>This year the World Wide Web celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary. What was once considered
                                luxury or entertainment has now become an essential for daily American life. The facts are
                                simple—students with broadband services at home have a higher graduation rate, and 50% of
                                today’s jobs require some technology skill. JumpWireless.org is providing a new platform

                            <p>After a serious motor vehicle accident, Spring found Plexus products on her journey to healing.
                                She loved how they made her feel, and knew she had to get involved. She is now an independent
                                distributor of Plexus products, or what she likes to call a “mompreneur”!</p>
                            <p>Being a distributor of Plexus allows her to share what the products have done for her with family
                                and friends. It also allows her to build her business on her time, much like a traditional
                                entrepreneur. She uses Grasshopper to keep in touch with her team members, and voicemail
                                transcription allows her to read her messages on the go.</p>

                            <p>Made up of a small team of passionate educators, Kevin from Magoosh tells us their mission is
                                to fix what’s broken in the test prep industry. They provide access to effective, affordable,
                                and enjoyable test prep so that every student has a fair shot at advancing their education
                                and realizing their full potential.</p>
                            <p>Because of their small size, they make great use of Grasshopper’s call forwarding feature. They
                                don’t have the resources for one person to answer phone calls, so having the ability of other
                                people jumping in to help out is super valuable.</p>
                            <p>Kevin tells us burritos are a favorite food at Magoosh, calling them “a marvel of culinary architecture!”</p>

                            <p>Justin says Grasshopper was originally a temporary solution, but they found that they were able
                                to grow their phone system with their team, and didn’t need a more elaborate solution. They’re
                                able to direct clients to the proper department seamlessly, which helps streamline their
                                day to day operations.</p>

                                mobile food industry. MOVE Systems technology enables access to on-site, self-service electricity
                                via industry standard charging stations and in-wall outlets for customers who initiate service
                                with their mobile phone. Super cool!</p>
                            <p>MOVE Systems founders wanted a cleaner, quieter, and less noisy mobile food industry, so they
                                created a technology that could provide that.</p>
                            <p>And how does MOVE Systems stay connected? Well, with Grasshopper of course! They love having

                            <p>The first Nickell Equipment Rental store opened in 1998 in Newnan, Georgia. While their business
                                has grown and times have changed, they still remain family owned and hold the same values:
                                ethics, their employees, and serving the same customers that made them successful.</p>
                            <p>Josh Nickell tells us they use Grasshopper to provide 24/7 support to their customers. They have
                                the ability to make reservations, get directions and store hours, or leave a message for
                                the management team at their home store.</p>
                            <p>In addition to being tool rental experts, the Josh tells us their favorite type of restaurant
                                is a good, old-fashioned steakhouse!</p>

                                They create and sell business names that come complete with a dot com domain and the choice
                                of a logo that fits your business.</p>
                            <p>Dave, one of the co-founders, says his business is different because they don’t simply buy and
                                sell domain names – they want to help small businesses with the whole package. Since they’re
                                a 100% online business with a worldwide customer base, Grasshopper helps them connect with
                                those that matter most: their clients!</p>
                            <p>When they’re not busy designing perfect business names and logos, Dave says they’re fueling their
                                growing addiction to veggie Indian food!</p>

                            <p>This website is totally unique—it’s a continuation of the novel with all articles written as

                            <p>R.L Akers users Grasshopper to stay connected. He loves having toll free numbers and the ease
                                of setting up extensions. He also appreciates that it doesn’t break the bank.</p>
                            <p>If R.L isn’t at home managing Orbital Defense Corps, he can be found on the Gulf Coast of Florida

                            <p>Ocasomedia is a PR & Advertising firm unlike the rest. Based in Lima, Peru, founder Bill McIntosh
                                handles PR for numerous US-based clients, including many authors.</p>
                            <p>His innovative approach to PR includes what he calls VIP Guest induction, Fixture Guesting, and
                                Left Field Guerrilla Promotion.</p>
                            <p>Bill founded Ocasomedia to provide sustained and effective media exposure. After working in the
                                pressure cooker of the New York City media industry, he resolved to find a different – and
                                better – way of doing PR.</p>
                            <p>Bill says his favorite food is pasta, and his favorite sport is baseball!</p>

                            <p>RankPay is an SEO agency that helps its small business customers increase their search rankings,
                                without any hidden costs or complicated contracts. Started by two college friends, Shawn
                                and his cofounder knew they wanted to create an SEO agency that was different, and they believe
                                they’ve succeeded.</p>
                            <p>With growth into over 600 cities in the US and 50 countries worldwide, RankPay uses Grasshopper
                                to keep their distributed remote team connected. They love being able to seamlessly forward
                                and answer calls from wherever they’re at.</p>
                            <p>It isn’t all work and no play, though. Shawn tells us his team loves watching football, and playing
                                in fantasy football!</p>

                                for buying and selling their homes, while keeping the process as stress-free as possible.</p>
                            <p>Brian says his favorite sport is drag racing, and his favorite vacation spot is right at home!</p>

                            <p>Rentity is a New York City real estate company with a goal of empowering renters to find the
                                best real estate options.</p>
                            <p>They describe their business as a “social rental experience that benefits everyone.” If you’re
                                moving out, you can find a new tenant for your place and receive a commission. If you’re
                                moving in, you can save money by bypassing the overpriced middle-man.</p>
                            <p>Cofounder Daniel Ahmadizadeh says he and his cofounders have really run the gauntlet of the New
                                York City real estate market, and they were inspired to create a better way.</p>
                            <p>Fun fact: Daniel says his favorite sport is quidditch!</p>

                            <p>Residential Acoustics patented and now designs and manufactures soundproofing curtains for doors
                                and windows in everyday homes.</p>
                            <p>Most customers live in apartments where double-pane windows aren't a feasible solution (plus,
                                who wants to pay a grand per window anyway?!). Residential Acoustics help these people improve
                                their lives!</p>
                            <p>“Just 6 months ago we were a startup in my garage,” says Walker Peek. “Now, we have customers
                                ordering curtains from all around the world.” Walker says that people are very happy to block
                                out this unwanted noise, but even happier to get back to the things they love doing</p>
                            <p>“If not for Grasshopper, we’d be juggling personal and work calls on one phone,” says Walker.

                            <p>RVT.com is an RV specific marketplace that over the years has grown from one single employee
                                to a team of 10. Throughout their 30 year history, they’ve cultivated an understanding of
                                the RV market and cater to it – both on the consumer and industry sides.</p>
                            <p>Grasshopper has allowed them to unite a distributed team to each other and their customers. They
                                love using the Read Your Voicemail feature, saying it helps them save time that would otherwise
                                be wasted listening to voicemails the old fashioned way.</p>
                            <p>When they’re not working hard to connect people with the right RV for them, they love to take
                                well-deserved time off, surfing in Maui!</p>

                            <p>SkinOwl is an all-natural skincare company and beauty consulting firm that is based in Los Angeles,
                                California. Its products are made with quality ingredients, and founder, Annie Tevelin emphasizes
                                philanthropy.</p>
                            <p>Because Annie struggled with skin issues, throwing tons of money into facials and visits to the
                                dermatologist, she was inspired to create SkinOwl. She wanted to build a company that could
                                make women feel as good as they look!</p>
                            <p>Annie uses Grasshopper’s services to stay connected. She loves having her voicemails transcribed
                                and thinks her professional voicemail recording sounds amazing (she used our Voice Studio).</p>
                            <p>When Annie isn’t busy in Los Angeles, you might find her in London, her favorite vacation spot.

                            <p>Skinny Driven Livin is a unique tool developed to help people lose weight and learn the effects
                                that food has on their bodies.</p>
                            <p>After struggling with weight loss and health conditions personally, founder Tina Herron discovered
                                a method that gave her excellent results.</p>
                            <p>Using this experience, Tina and her husband developed a suite of online tools that allow members
                                to learn, track, and be successful in their weight loss journeys, too.</p>
                            <p>Tina says her favorite food is chicken wings, and her favorite sport is ocean kayaking!</p>

                            <p>SoundBetter helps music production professionals get more work by giving them a platform to set
                                up a beautiful portfolio in minutes for free, where they can showcase their skills, credits,
                                gear, areas of specialty, genres, budget, location and know-how. Musicians looking for producers,
                                recording studios and engineers can find, hire and pay top professionals through a single
                                platform. </p>
                            <p>SoundBetter’s founder, Shachar Gilard, was a one man show for over a year while he worked to
                                build his community. Now a 500 Startups company, SoundBetter is thousands of users strong
                                and has dozens of Grammy winning producers on their platform.</p>
                            <p>Shachar loves that Grasshopper’s call forwarding lets him receive calls no matter where he is,
                                making it easy for him to work on the road. When he’s not working to connect music professionals,
                                you might find Shachar enjoying some pizza, his favorite food.</p>

                                Tamara sought out to ensure mothers and families are as informed as possible.</p>

                            <p>Titan PPC is a self-proclaimed team of pay per click geeks that eat, sleep, breath, and cry over
                                PPC. Instead of offering a handful of services (such as SEO, social media, and web design),
                                Titan PPC’s strength comes from a hyper-focus on just one thing—PPC!</p>
                            <p>The team’s attention is completely directed to driving high quality, high converting traffic
                                straight to websites through search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing and even Facebook PPC
                                advertising.</p>
                            <p>Patrick Schrodt, founder of Titan PPC, loves Grasshopper because it makes his professional life
                                easy and simple. “It also helped us grow to where we are today,” he says, “and having a toll
                                free number made us look bigger when starting up a few years ago.”</p>
                            <p>When Patrick and his team aren’t eating PPC for breakfast, you might find them golfing in Vancouver,
                                B.C.</p>

                            <p>Trinity Family Counseling Center is a Christian counseling center. They provide a large span
                                of services to families, couples, and individuals of all faiths including offering groups

                            <p>Trinity Family Counseling Center’s goal is to “assist clients in their efforts to make changes

                            <p>Owner and Director of Counseling Tonya Ratliff is the mother of a blended family, so she finds
                                issues of divorce and second families particularly rewarding to work through.</p>

                            <p>Jason Potter was tired of seeing struggling performers unable to harness the power of live video
                                streaming because of high prices. So he created VidTime, a new way of empowering artists
                                that allows them to stream events for free and collect PPV sales from fans.</p>
                            <p>Concerts, comedy shows, and speeches are great ways to bring people from different parts of the
                                world (or country, or even one city) together with a shared experience. VidTime allows for
                                that to happen in real time, which is much more powerful than recorded content. </p>
                            <p>And of course, VidTime is a happy Grasshopper customer. Jason loves that it’s easy to manage
                                employee extensions, especially because of his remote workers. As a small business owner,
                                Jason appreciates the ease and flexibility.</p>
                            <p>When Jason isn’t watching live stream videos, you might find him watching (or playing) hockey.
                                “Come on,” he says, “I’m Canadian!”</p>

                            <p>ZoomShift is a software company that provides entrepreneurs with all the tools they need to schedule,
                                so that they can get back to the important aspects of their lives.</p>
                            <p>ZoomShift’s main reason behind starting this “ready to lend a hand” software was so that users
                                of the service could focus their time and energy on more essential tasks of running a business.
                                It just gets a lot easier with ZoomShift!</p>
                            <p>Of course, ZoomShift is also a Grasshopper customer. Jon Hainstock, the ZoomShift's Co-founder,
                                loves the professional feel that Grasshopper gives his company. He’s partial to our iPhone
                                app—it’s his favorite feature.</p>
                            <p>But Jon isn’t just into scheduling software. He also loves Kehr’s Sour Gummy Bears and has been
                                known to say (we quote) “Nom Nom!” </p>
